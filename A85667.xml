            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>When Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whoſe memory is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, was <hi>inſtigated</hi> by ſome <hi>ill-affected</hi> to the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie,</hi> to abridge the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>Preachers,</hi> E.G. Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> was much troubled at it, and
<pb facs="tcp:117768:3"/> wrote her a learn'd and ſerious Letter about it, out of which having the Manuſcript by mee, I have thought fit to tranſcribe and commend unto you what followes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I cannot marvell enough, how this ſtrange opinion ſhould once enter into your minde, that it ſhould be good for the Church to have few Preachers? Alas</hi> Madame, <hi>is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more plain in any one thing, then that the Goſpel of Christ ſhould be plentifully produced? and that plenty of</hi> Labourers <hi>ſhould be ſent into the Lords harvest, which being great and large, ſtandeth in need of not a few but many workmen. There were appointed to the building of</hi> Solomons <hi>materiall Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple an hundred and fifteene thouſand artificers and labourers, beſides three hundred and thirty Overſeers, and ſhall we think that a few Preachers may ſuffice to build and edifie the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Temple of Christ, which is the Church. Christ when he ſendeth forth his Apoſtles, ſaith unto them;</hi> Ite praedicate Euangelium omni creaturae. <hi>But all Gods creatures cannot be inſtructed in the Goſpel, unleſſe all poſsible means be uſed to have a multitude of Preachers and Teachers to preach unto them.</hi> Habitet ſermo Chriſti in vobis opulenter, <hi>ſaith</hi> Paul, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>And to</hi> Timothy, Praedica ſermonem, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta tempeſtive, intempeſtive, argue, increpa, exhortare, <hi>which thing cannot be done without often and much preaching. To this agreeth the practiſe of Christs Apoſtles;</hi> Qui conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuebant per ſingulas Eccleſias presbyteros, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. Paul <hi>likewiſe to</hi> Titus <hi>writeth;</hi> Hujus rei gratia reliqui te in Creta, ut quae deſunt pergas corrigere &amp; conſtituas oppidatim presbyteros: <hi>and afterward deſcribeth how the</hi> Presbyterie <hi>ſhould be qualified, not ſuch as we are compelled to admit, by meere neceſsitie, unleſſe we ſhould leave a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb facs="tcp:117768:4"/> of Churches utterly deſolate, but ſuch indeed as were able to exhort</hi> Per ſanam doctrinam &amp; contradicentes convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. <hi>And in this place I beſeech your</hi> Majeſty, <hi>to note one thing neceſſary to be noted, which is this. If the Holy Ghost preſcribe expreſly that Preachers ſhould be placed</hi> oppidatim, <hi>how can it well be thought that two or three Preachers may ſuffice for a Shire. Publike and continuall preaching of Gods Word is the ordinary means and inſtrument of the ſalvation of mankinde. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> Paul <hi>calls it</hi> The miniſterie of reconciliation of man unto God. <hi>By the preaching of Gods Word, the glory of God is inlarged, faith nouriſhed, and charity increaſed, by it igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is inſtructed, the negligent exhorted and incited, the ſtubborne rebuked, the weake comforted, and to all thoſe that ſin of malicious wickedneſs, the wrath of God is threatned. By preaching alſo, due obedience to Chriſtian Princes and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates is planted in the hearts of Subjects: For obedience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of conſcience, conſcience is grounded upon the Word of God, and the Word of God worketh this effect by preaching, ſo as generally where preaching is neglected, obedience faileth. No Prince ever had more lively experience herof then your</hi> Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie <hi>hath had in your time, and may have daily. If your</hi> Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie <hi>come to the Citie of</hi> London <hi>never ſo often, what great gratulation, what joy, what concourſe of people is there to be ſeene, yea what acclamations and prayers to God for your long life, and other manifeſt ſignifications of inward and unfeined love joyn'd with moſt humble and heartie obedience, are there to be heard? Whereof cometh this</hi> Madame, <hi>but of the continuall preaching of Gods Word in the Citie, whereby</hi> that people <hi>hath been plenteouſly inſtructed in their dutie towards God, and towards your</hi> Majeſtie. <hi>On the contrary, what bred the</hi> Rebellion <hi>in the North? Was it not Papiſtrie, and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods holy Word through want of preaching? And in the time of that</hi> Rebellion, <hi>were not all men of all eſtates that
<pb facs="tcp:117768:4"/> made profeſsion of the Goſpel, most ready to offer their lives for your defence? in ſo much that one poore Pariſh in</hi> Yorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, <hi>which by continuall preaching had been better inſtructed then the rest,</hi> Halifax, <hi>I meane was ready to bring three or foure thouſand able men into the field, to ſerve you against the ſaid rebells. How can your</hi> Majeſtie <hi>have a more lively tryall and experience of the contrary effects of much preaching, and little or no preaching, the one working most unnaturall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and rebellion, the other most faithfull obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this part of the Letter, you ſee, how firme the Archbiſhop was for preaching, and that he hath fully confirm'd that ſenſe of the words; Where there is no viſion or preaching the people will <hi>rebell,</hi> and if he would not yeeld to the abridging of preachers, why ſhould any deſire the aboliſhing of them? and ſo make way for the people to be <hi>idle, naked, ſcattred, rebellious,</hi> yea for their <hi>periſhing.</hi> It was one of the ſaddeſt times that ever <hi>Iſrael</hi> had, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was without a <hi>teaching Prieſt,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.3. then they had no <hi>peace</hi> within nor without, but great <hi>vexations</hi> were upon all the inhabitants of the Countries, even all the ten Tribes. This being without a <hi>Teaching Prieſt</hi> was ſuch an affliction, as that the Lord promiſed his people afterwards, that what affliction ſoever befell them, this ſhould not, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.20. Though the Lord give you the bread of adverſitie, and water of affliction, yet ſhall not thy

               <hi>Teachers</hi> be removed into a corner any more: but thine eyes ſhall ſee thy <hi>Teachers.</hi> This is a gratious promiſe for the continuance of the <hi>Miniſterie.</hi> They had the law, and ſhould have <hi>Teachers</hi> to inſtruct them therein. Wee have the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> to inſtruct us therein. The Church and Miniſterie may be hid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6. but not extinct.

<pb facs="tcp:117768:6"/> when he ſaid, Take my life from me; for its bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for me to die then to live; and I doe well to be angry unto death, <hi>Jon.</hi> 4.3.9. And <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſes he had no Commandement of the Lord concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virgins, but gave his judgement as one that had obteind mercy of the LORD to be faithfull, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.25. Now though theſe men had ſuch <hi>fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> ſpake from their <hi>own ſpirits,</hi> yet were neither the <hi>Churches falſified</hi> hereby, nor their <hi>callings fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</hi> That which was needfull to be the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Standard,</hi> was given out by an infallible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The Spirit of truth tooke of Chriſts, ſhew'd it to them, and led them into all truth. And while the Miniſters now doe bring that truth unto you they are <hi>infallible.</hi> If in their conſtructions, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, and expoſitions of the ſame, they <hi>varie</hi> or be <hi>out,</hi> you ought to try the ſpirits, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1. and to hold faſt what is good, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.21. not deſpiſing prophecyings, leaſt you quench the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

<pb facs="tcp:117768:6"/> they are bruiſed and broken. The fire of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary yeelds moſt heat and light when ſtirr'd up and blowne. Its neither fleſhly, devilliſh, nor tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the Father, to make conſtructions upon the Prophets and Apoſtles, and expound their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If ſo, then <hi>Ezra</hi> and others who read the Law and gave the ſenſe of it, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.8. ſinned, were fleſhly, devilliſh, and traytors to the Father. Then <hi>Paul</hi> gave ill counſell to <hi>Timothie,</hi> to divide the word of truth aright, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. How children ſhould have their milke, young men their bread, old men their wine, and that onely by reading, I ſee not. If that could be ſurely Chriſt needed not have appointed a wiſe and faithfull ſervant over his houſhold, to give them meat in due ſeaſon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.45. If wee may not expound the Word becauſe we are fallible, then why ſhould any tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate the Word out of the Originall Tongue into others, ſeeing they are fallible, and may, yea have miſtaken therein, as well as others in expounding and preaching: and becauſe it is ſo, ſome little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>

                  <p>God honoured his owne day, with giving out his Word by Revelations and Viſions; that day they reſted from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and were fitteſt to heare, ſee, and receive divine thinge.

                  <p>The Prophets had not all communicated to them at once, but by degrees, as infinite wiſedome ſaw beſt, and the Church underſtands not all at once what they wrote, but now a little, and then a little, as it pleaſes God to let in light.</p>

                     <p>Concerning the firſt, it's queſtionable from whom he would turne his face, from the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> or from the <hi>Jewes.</hi> Some cary it from the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and ſo the ſenſe is this: Though they be a barbarous people, and doe unheard of things, pollute my holy place, ſack my holy City, burn all to the ground, ſlay and captive my people, yet I will turne my face from them, I will not reſtrain them at all, but let them goe on freely and fully in ſuch wayes, and take no notice of any thing done againſt mee or my worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Others to whom I incline, expound it of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that God would turn his face from them: and then the meaning is, that God would afford them neither his preſence, counſel, comfort, nor deliverance; but he would leave them to ſhift for themſelves and take no further care of them. Gods face in the Scripture ſignifies;</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Eſpecially in times of Affliction, God takes notice what truths are commended by the Prophets unto men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is more particularized then any where elſe, becauſe many were now in Captivity, the reſt were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and of all truths, thoſe will coſt deareſt that are preacht unto us in our afflictions and not improv'd.</p>

In <hi>Marthas</hi> houſe Chriſt preached, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. The Diſciples met every firſt day, in houſes and chambers, and when they were ſo met, <hi>Paul</hi> preached to them.

They are a Conventicle, a Faction, that in hatred of Good men, meet and plot againſt them, pretending they are the cauſe of all evils and diſturbances.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Prelats dayes there was much rigour and ſeverity uſed againſt godly meetings of this nature, more then ever we read of formerly: It can hardly be ſhewn in Scripture, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hat ever any met together in private to worſhip the Lord, were ſurpriz'd, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted, taken, or impriſon'd. For their publique preaching they were frequently queſtioned, and ſuffered; Its not ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dent that they did for their private meetings.</p>
                     <p>Theſe they had in <hi>Babylon</hi> without imputation or moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhall not <hi>Sion</hi> be as indulgent to her children as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> was to her enemies?

                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. God honours holy meetings, though they be private, the hand of the Lord fell <hi>there</hi> and <hi>then</hi> upon the Prophet. Where two or 3. meet together in a ſacred manner, God will be in the midſt of them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. He will be Preſident of that mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and powerfull in it, not only ſhew his preſence and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in an ordinary way, but many times extraordinarily, as at this time, <hi>John</hi> 20.19. When the Diſciples were aſſembled in private, <hi>Jeſus ſtood in the middeſt of them, and ſaid, peace be unto you.</hi> And ſo in the 26. <hi>v.</hi> when they were met in private Chriſt came amongſt them, he honoured their meetings in a ſpeciall manner with his preſence, bleſſing, and miracles. The world hath prejudice againſt ſuch meetings, ſpeaks ill, and attempts the ruine of them; but Chriſt thinks honourably of them, puts honour upon, and manifeſts his acceptance of them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. When the Apoſtles were got together in a hou e, the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven tongues of fire ſate upon each of them, <hi>and they were filled with the holy Spirit, Acts</hi> 10.44. While <hi>Peteter</hi> was preaching in <hi>Cornelius</hi> houſe, the holy Ghoſt fell upon them. And you will ſcarcely find ſuch viſible ſignes of Gods preſence in publique, as were then in private.</p>
                     <p>I ſpeak not this to diſparage publique meetings, God is in the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:117768:77"/> ſolemn Aſſemblies, there his glory and power is ſeene. But to take off that Odium is in the hearts of many againſt all private meetings.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Thoſe wait upon God in the wayes of his worſhip are not looſers by it. The Elders came to the Prophet, ſate there, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſomething from him, and they had more then ordinary. They beheld the hand of God upon the Prophet, and were made witneſſes of that viſion hee had, and partakers of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The people that flocked after Chriſt into the field, had the Word, &amp; beſide that, the loaves &amp; fiſhes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. When the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were met together to worſhip the Lord the firſt day of the weeke, Chriſt came to them, breath'd upon, and gave them the holy Ghoſt, <hi>John</hi> 20.19.22 <hi>Paul</hi> ſeekes God in prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11. and continued in it; behold he prayes, he was at it night and day, and <hi>Ananias</hi> was ſent to him to help him to his ſight, and to the holy Ghoſt, ſo that he might ſee men, and how to ſave men. Old <hi>Simeon,</hi> and old <hi>Anna</hi> the Propheteſſe, they came into the Temple to ſerve the Lord, and at that time Chriſt is brought in, whom they ſee, and magnifie God for, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. In <hi>Acts</hi> 16.13. You read how <hi>Paul</hi> left the City and went to a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſide, where women did uſually meet to pray, thither many were come, and to them <hi>Paul</hi> preaches, <hi>Lidias</hi> heart is opened, and Chriſt let in, who was before a ſtranger unto her: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this ſhe was baptized, and gain'd the company of the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Apoſtles, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10. faſts and prayes, and he hath an Angel ſent to him, to aſſure him, that all was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in heaven, and to help him to the ſpeech of an Apoſtle, whom hearing, he received the holy Ghoſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 44. Men loſe not, but gain greatly by waiting upon God in his Ordinances. If they have not what they expect ſometimes, they have more then they look for at other times. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that heareth me</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.34. <hi>watching daily at my gates, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the poſts of my doors,</hi> They are bleſſed already, and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected bleſſings are waiting for them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That former, operations and impreſſions of the Spirit, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice not the holieſt of men, when new ſervices are to be done. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was a holy Prophet, hee had the hand of God, the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:117768:77"/> vertue of the Spirit <hi>falling upon him</hi> before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.3. <hi>entering into him, Chap.</hi> 2.2. <hi>ſtrongly upon him, Chap</hi> 3.14. And yet all this was not ſufficient, there was new work for him, new viſions to be ſeene and given out, and the hand of the Lord fell anew upon him.</p>
                     <p>New employments muſt have new influences; new tryals muſt have new ſtrength: If we truſt to antecedent receipts, we ſhall miſcarry. <hi>Peter</hi> fail'd when hee came to encounter with a new tryal, he lean'd upon what he had, and looked not up for more. <hi>Paul</hi> he ſtood, when buffeted by a meſſenger of Satan; and why? being conſcious of his own weakneſſe, and inſufficiency of what he had received, he ſought to God, who told him, <hi>my grace is ſufficient for thee;</hi> not the graces I have given thee, but <hi>the grace I have to give thee.</hi> If a meſſenger of Sathan moleſt thee, be too ſtrong for thee, I have a meſſenger, even my Spirit of grace, that ſhall come and comfort thee, that is ſtronger then all, and ſhall uphold thee. <hi>Paul</hi> had experience of this, and therefore counſels <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. To <hi>be ſtrong in the grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Though he had unfeigned faith, knew the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from a child, had a gift given him by the laying on of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands; yet hee muſt not be ſtrong in theſe, but in the grace of Chriſt, ſee his ſtrength lye there: former impreſſions of Chriſt Spirit ware out, and receiv'd vertue is ſoone ſpent: Wee muſt looke for new Influences, Impreſſions and Operations of the hand of Chriſt, elſe all will be too little, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Awake O North wind, and come thou South, blow upon my garden, that the ſpices thereof may flow.</hi> And <hi>Sampſon</hi> called unto the Lord, and ſaid, <hi>O Lord God remember me, I pray thee, and ſtrengthen me I pray thee only this once, Judges</hi> 16.28.</p>

                     <p>No gate was ſo called originally; but after <hi>Ahaz</hi> had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the worſhip of God by his Altar from <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> fixed an Altar by that gate, and brought the Lords Altar thither, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 16.14. It's conceiv'd here upon this gate was called the <hi>Altar-gate,</hi> there was an Altar for <hi>Baal,</hi> and a miſ-plac'd Altar for God.</p>
                     <p>If we will rightly diſcerne the corruption in worſhip,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1.</note> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between what is humane, and what is divine; wee muſt ſet the eyes of our minds a work, they muſt be lift up, be open, and intent to the thing: There is great difference between the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall view, and judgement of the fleſh, and between the internall view and judgement of the ſpirit. This <hi>Baaliticall</hi> Altar, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, was glorious outwardly, as falſe worſhip is, (<hi>Jeroboams</hi> Calves were golden ones, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.28.) and affected the eys, ſtole away the hearts of many; but it was loathſome to the eye of a judicious conſidering minde; Gods worſhip was hindered, defiled by it, his jealouſie provoked, and their ruine procured by it.</p>
                     <p>The Popiſh Religion is pompous, and to carnall eyes hath beauty in it; but to thoſe that lift up the eyes of their mind, and well conſider, it's ſuperſtitious, idolatrous, and abhominable; ſome have called the Ceremonies uſed lately in our worſhip, <hi>Innocent:</hi> but thoſe examine them well, found them <hi>Nocent,</hi> the ſeed of contention, ſnares to conſcience, and flyes in our preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oyntment, <hi>John</hi> 7.24. <hi>Judge not hence-forth according to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, but judge righteous judgement.</hi> See exactly into things, let the eyes be lift up, and ſo ſhal you paſſe a more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſentence.</p>
                     <p>How pompous was our worſhip become lately; but ſince eyes have been lift up, the vanity, corruption, and ſuperſtition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath appeared.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They may ſafely obſerve, examine the nature and ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of falſe worſhip, who have a call unto it: The Lord Chriſt he bids <hi>Ezekiel</hi> behold the Image of Jealouſie: See what the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did there, the Prophet did not willingly lift up his eyes, but
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:117768:85"/> at command, and being lawfully cal'd to it, there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being ſeduc'd, of bowing to <hi>Baal,</hi> of countenancing falſe worſhip; God keeps thoſe are in the way he ſets them. Had the Prophet out of curioſity and deſire to ſee this Altar, this Image, gone to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he might have been enſnared, as too many of our Nation by going to <hi>Rome,</hi> having no better ground than an itching deſire to ſee and know what's done there.</p>
                     <p>Romiſh worſhip hath inveigled them, Jeſuitical charmes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched them, &amp; loſt they have both truth, and innocency, their conſciences have been defiled, and their judgments prejudiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe wayes they were formerly acquainted with: If the ſpirits of ſome have beene heightned againſt thoſe abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the ſight of them, this is matter for wonder, not for i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation: Its not ſafe entring into the Lyons den, becauſe one <hi>Daniel</hi> was kept ſafe there: where one hath been preſerved, ſcores have been corrupted, and many of them inſenſibly. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſay, <hi>an egge wrapt up in ſalt, looſes the good meat was in it, the ſhell remaining whole.</hi> And ſo when young ones travail into thoſe brackiſh Countreyes, and live amongſt thoſe are ſalted with Popery, they loſe the good ſavor they had of true religion, and only the ſhell remains whole.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. See here the tractableneſſe, the obedientiall frame of the Prophets ſpirit: Chriſt commands him to lift up his eyes, and ſo he lift up his eyes, he doubted not, diſputed not, he lingred not; but the word being given out, immediately he obeyes, his ſpirit was ſet towards, and ſuitable to the will of Chriſt: Hee might have ſtuck and ſaid, it's an abhominable Idoll, an accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thing that provokes thee to Jealouſie, mine eyes ſhall never ſee that ſo pollutes thy worſhip, and is ſo contrary to thy glory; but he preſently ſubmits, and fulfils the will of Chriſt, which is very acceptable unto him.<note place="margin">Exod. 4.14.</note> 
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> delayes made God angry, and it's the great ſhift of Satan to keep men off from obeying the will and voyce of God by delaye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He doth not tell men the commands in Scripture are not the commands of God; but hee cauſeth delayes, and ſo impedes, retards the execution of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine commands: So that God is hearkned unto, months, and yeares, after the command is gone forth, ſuch obedience is not ſo precious and acceptable. <hi>David</hi> knew it, and therefore ſaith,

                           <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1.</note> God had given them pure Ordinances in the Temple, and there he was, abode, dwelt, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.15. <hi>He dwelt between the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins.</hi> They were upon the Arke of the Covenant in the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary where God manifeſted himſelfe, and gave out oracles to thoſe ſought him; hereupon <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 27.4. deſired to dwell in the houſe of the Lord, to <hi>behold</hi> the beauty of the Lord, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:117768:86"/> to enquire in his Temple; there he ſaw the beautifull face of God, and heard his ſweet voyce. God is in his own ordinances, when the Temple is meaſured out, and the holy City built ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods mind, and then the name ſhall be <hi>Jehovah Shammah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 48.35.</note> 
                        <hi>the Lord is there,</hi> and the Churches whilſt golden can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks Chriſt is in the midſt of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Corruptions, Abhominations in worſhip, cauſe the Lord to leave his people, to depart from his Sanctuary, they brought in heathniſh Altars, ſet up <hi>Baal,</hi> and remov'd Gods Altar out of its place, and hereupon, God forſakes his dwelling-place, his preſence, protection, counſell, countenance, bleſſings are all with-drawn from them, and woe is to that people when God goeth out of the Sanctuary, if outward calamities doe not ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine them, ſpirituall judgements undoe them. But ſee the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe of falſe worſhip, mens additions and mixtures with the pure Ordinances of the Lord, they are as ſmoak to Gods eyes, vinegar and gall to his taſt, abhominations to his Spirit; If they muſt into his houſe, he will out of it: when the Ark comes in, <hi>Dagon</hi> goes down: and when <hi>Dagon</hi> comes in, the Arke goes out. In Chriſts time, the Temple was a den of thieves, and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> was not amongſt them, its needfull therefore to ſtand contend for pure ordinances, and divine worſhip.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Men may have ordinances, and forms of worſhip, without God in them; they had the Sanctuary, Altars, Sacrifices, when God was gone from them, yea <hi>farre</hi> from them; as they had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ordinances, ſo powerleſſe ordinances, there was nothing of God, Chriſt, or his Spirit in them: when God is out of the Sanctuary it matters not who is there, or what is done there, all is to little purpoſe, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.11, 12. There was a winde, an earth-quake, a fire, but God was in neither of them: and let there be Prieſts and Levites, ſacrifice and incenſe, preaching and praying, God is not in them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There are degrees of ſinnes; abhominations, great, and greater, ſins of ignorance are of a low nature, ſinnes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge higher; the more of the head and heart is in a ſinne, the worſe, the greater it is; knowledg, and will, do edifie ſin much. <hi>Davids</hi> murther, <hi>Peters</hi> denyall of Chriſt, were ſins more hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous then others which they committed.</p>

                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:117768:86"/>5. God diſcovers ſins by degrees, not all at once, he had ſhewn him great abhominations, and Chriſt bids him turne, and he ſhould ſee greater abhominations. Sins are not all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at once, nor all diſcovered at once, they grow by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and are diſcovered by degrees. Abhominations in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Churches, lye wrapt up in the mantle of ſecreſie and darkeneſſe; but God hath his times to diſcover and make them knowne to the ſonnes of men, <hi>Hoſea:</hi> 2.10. <hi>Now will I diſcover her lewdneſſe. Ephraim</hi> had ſinned, added abhomination to abhomination, lewdneſſe to lewdneſſe, and they had beene covered up for a ſeaſon, but now the diſcovering time was come, ſeverall Murthers and Adulteries were brought to light. <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Samaria's</hi> ſinnes were made knowne when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to be healed, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7.1. When God would come and cover the wounds of his owne people, then the wickedneſſe of their enemies are laid open: It's evident in our dayes, God hath beene upon healing <hi>England,</hi> and the ſinnes of many have been diſcovered.</p>
                     <p>Eſtates and Churches are like bodies full of groſſe and noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humours, ſtirr them a little, and they appeare to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the whole.</p>

You may think, it's never ſo with God; but the Scripture ſaith it here, and in other places, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13, 14. <hi>Thou wilt not be purged, I will cauſe my fury to reſt upon thee,</hi> and what ever you commit, <hi>I the LORD have ſpoken it, it ſhall come to paſſe, and I will doe it, I will not goe backe, neither will I ſpare, neither will I repent, according to thy wayes, and according to thy doings ſhall they judge thee ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Men are apt to thinke GOD is all mercy, but they will finde it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
                     <p>His eye that ſpared them in Egypt, that looked upon them, and pittyed them there, his eye will not ſpare, himſelfe will not pitty them in <hi>Sion.</hi> Their provocations were great, he that ſpared <hi>Nineuites,</hi> will not ſpare <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When God deales in fury, there is no dealing with him then, hee is a conſuming fire, and nothing will prevaile with him.</p>
                     <p>What if they cry, will not that prevaile? Is not God a God hearing prayer, doth he not heare the cry of Ravens? <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.11. <hi>Though they cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them, Iſa.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.45.</p>
                     <p>What if <hi>Noah, Job,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhould pray, would not God be intreated, pitty, and ſpare them? ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14.18.20.

                     <p>Crying in man is intenſe or loud ſpeaking, when it's expres'd by a loud voyce: but God cryeth not as man. His crying is the efficacy of his Spirit, or force of his providence ſtrongly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the creature to the execution of his will, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.7.

God ſaid unto <hi>Shimei,</hi> curſe <hi>David;</hi> that is, Divine providence mov'd him to doe ſo. God cryes to the Miniſters of Juſtice, when he moves their wills to come and do execution upon a ſinfull people.

                     <p>Let not us be aſham'd of God and his cauſe, but openly and truly profeſſe him and his wayes, wee ſhall looſe nothing by it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Them that honour me, I wil honour, and they that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe me ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> If we have ſhame with men, and honor with God, vilified on earth, &amp; be accepted in heaven, we have no cauſe to be diſcouraged. Its likely the godly here were reproached, threatned, hardly uſed; but becauſe they honour'd God, God own'd them, and who ever honour'd God, and was not honour'd by him? The 3. children would not obey <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars</hi> command, nor worſhip his image,<note place="margin">

                     <p n="1">1. They comply not; wickedneſſe is powerfull, and hath its arguments of pleaſure, profit, countenance, to draw good men to ſide with her; but they are things intractable: <hi>How can I doe this wickedneſſe,</hi>

And ſee what he reſolved upon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. he would rather cut them off, then countenance them. Grace is as ſtrong in the Saints, as corruption is in the wicked.

Nothing went ſo to his heart as the diſhonour of God, whoſe glory ſhining in his word and Ordinances, is dearer to the godly then their lives. <hi>Elijah</hi> deſired to dye when he ſaw God ſo diſhonoured by <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iezabel.</hi> The eye is for two things, for ſight and tears; if we ſee God diſhonoured, preſently our eyes ſhould be filled with teares.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. It's argument we mourn for ſin as ſin when we mourn for it in others. Sinne is the breach of the Law any where, and if I grieve, ſigh, cry for it in my ſelfe, and not in others, its ſome ſelviſh reſpect, not the nature of ſinne which cauſeth that mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; he hates poiſon as poiſon hates it every where, in whoſe handſoever it be, and he mourns for ſinne as ſin, would neither himſelfe, nor have others violate the law of God.</p>

                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p>Our Prelats who were Sanctuary-men, and pretended divine inſtitution for their ſtanding, declared by their fruits that they were not from above, but from beneath: an earthly generation that hath been eminent in Treaſons, Conſpiracies, Rebellions, ſeditious Innovations and corruptions of Religion as ever was; but God hath found them out, powred contempt upon them, plucked them up by the rootes. <hi>Strafford</hi> and <hi>Canterbury</hi> were heads of wickedneſſe in the Church and State, and God hath lopped off their heads.

It's not the holineſſe of any place can mitigate or avert the wrath of God, when thoſe belong to it have defil'd the place with their abhominations.

Divine juſtice oft ſmites ſinners in the place where they have ſin'd; they had defi 'd the Temple with their abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with idolatry, falſe worſhip, hypocriſie &amp; vain confidence in it, and there God commands them to be put to death. God had manifeſted great love, beſtowed great mercies, imparted much light to them, heard their prayers, accepted their ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Temple, and now ſeeing there they ſin'd againſt him, there hee would have shem puniſhed. When <hi>Ahab</hi> had murthered <hi>Naboth,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. this meſſage was ſent unto him: <hi>In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, ſhall dogges licke

Gods judgments are as extenſive as ſinners ſins, they muſt ſlay not only Sanctuary-ſinners, but City-ſinners; they had ſin'd every where, the Land was full of violence, and now the Land, City, Sanctuary, were full of bloody men, and bloody judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and as they had fil'd all with ſinne, ſo they muſt fill all with ſlain ones. When ſins are generall, judgements are anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.8. ſpeaking of the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> it's ſaid, <hi>he ſhall paſſe through Judah, he ſhall overflow and goe over, he ſhall reach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the necke, and the ſtretching out of his wings ſhall fill the breadths of thy land.</hi> This is ſpoken of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> who like a flood over all the land came up to the <hi>necke,</hi> viz. <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> came not only up to the neck <hi>to Jeruſalem,</hi> but into it, and overflowed the head, he drowned all in blood; where there was no mark, there was no mercy to be ſhewed.</p>

                     <p>The godly doe ſympathize with the miſeries of others,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1.</note> the Prophet here is affected greatly with the judgements of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this people: When the Prophets told them of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments comming upon them, they thought hardly of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, they could not heare them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Prophets hated them, and meant them no good; but when the things they fore-told came to paſſe, they pittied them, and mourned for them: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> through deepe ſenſe of their ſlaughter, falls downe, and ſhed tears as they ſhed blood: their bodies were wounded, and his heart was wounded, wounded for their ſins, wounded for Gods wrath and heavy judgements were now upon them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.1. <hi>Oh that my head were waters, &amp; mine eyes a fountaine of teares, that I might weepe day and night for the ſlaine of the daughter of my people. Jeremiah</hi> ſo ſympathiz'd with them, that he had a mind neither to eate, drink, or ſleep, but only to weep night and day; tears ſhould be his meat, drink, and ſleep. Such a ſympathizing man was <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 9 12, 13. When the people had ſin'd in making them a Calviſh god, and Gods wrath was comming out to their deſtruction, what did <hi>Moſes, verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>Hee fell downe before the Lord forty dayes and forty nights, and did neither eate bread, nor drinke water, becauſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:117768:132"/> had ſin'd, and provoked God to anger.</hi> Here was a man affected with their miſeries, (I was afraid ſaith he, of the anger and hot diſpleaſure wherewith the Lord was wrath againſt you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy you.) Forty dayes did <hi>Moſes</hi> mourn for them, and humble himſelfe: and this kind of mourning 40. dayes in caſe of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome think riſeth from Gods raining upon the world 40. dayes, and 40. nights. Anſwerable to which, <hi>Moſes, Eliah,</hi> and Chriſt faſted, mourned and prayed, and ſo to <hi>Nineveh</hi> 40. days was given them to prevent their deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>This duty of ſympathizing with others in their miſery, was <hi>Davids</hi> practiſe; though they were wicked, and rewarded him evill, yet if they were in miſery, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 35.11. he would ſhare in it. When they were ſicke, his cloathing was ſack-cloath, he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his ſoule with faſting. Wicked men laugh and are glad at the miſeries of the godly, but the godly ſigh and mourn at, and for the miſeries of the wicked, they remember the Apoſtolicall command, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.15. <hi>Weepe with them that weepe,</hi> that will be ſome eaſe to them to ſee others ſenſible of their condition. This makes them like to Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Hee is touched with our infirmities.</hi> Judgements are upon the Kingdome: many of Gods deare ſervants as well as others ſuffer hard things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Take notice of their grievances, burthens, dangers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Mind them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Be tender affectioned towards them.</p>
                     <p>And 4. helpe them what you can, and this is true ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſervants of God that draw neere him in time of his judgements, are conſcious to themſelves of their own weakneſſe, ſinfulneſſe, and unworthineſſe. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> fals down upon his face as unworthy to look upon the great and glorious God, his own ſins and infirmities made him hide his face, &amp; the great wrath of God againſt his people made him tremble. When <hi>Abraham</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied with the Lord, being about to deſtroy <hi>Sodom,</hi> he remembred that he was <hi>duſt and aſhes, Gen.</hi> 18.27. God is terrible in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; humility is the beſt poſture an angry God can finde any in; when wee lye proſtrate at his feete he will not deſtroy us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thoſe are faithfull meſſengers of God will deprecate judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when they are comming upon the people. <hi>Ah Lord God,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:117768:132"/> wilt thou, &amp;c.</hi> So did <hi>Moſes</hi> that was faithfull in Gods houſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.11, 12, 13.32. where hee uſes ſtrong arguments to preſſe the Lord to forgive their ſins, to divert his wrath, and to ſpare their lives, or elſe to blot him out of his booke. <hi>Joſhuah</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> lie upon their faces, put duſt upon their heads, and pray earneſtly to God not to deliver them into the hands of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and to remember his great name, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.6, 7.9. <hi>Samuel</hi> thought it a ſin for him not to pray for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when they were in danger of deſtruction, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.19.23. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould ſinne in ceaſing to pray for you.</hi> Hee had done it, and would ſtill doe it, and if poſſible, turne away the diſpleaſure of the moſt High. <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> when a great Army was comming upon them, and ready to over-runne all, hee makes an effectuall prayer, produceth ſtrong arguments, which you may read, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. from Gods power in heaven and earth, from the experience they had of him, in driving our enemies, and giving them the Land, from the Sanctuary built for honour of his Name, and his promiſe to heare prayer there; from the ſpring of the enemies when they came out of Aegypt, and their intentions now to caſt them out of Gods poſſeſſion, and then concludes with a conquering ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of faith: <hi>O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have not might againſt this great company that commeth againſt us: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know we what to doe, but our eyes are upon thee.</hi> He firſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came God by his mighty prayer, and then overcame the enemies. <hi>Jeremie</hi> ſeeing a great famine upon the people, he ſees upon God, <hi>Ch.</hi> 14.7, 8.9. <hi>O Lord, though our iniquities teſtifie againſt us, doe thou it for thy names ſake: O the hope of Iſrael, the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble, why ſhouldſt thou be as a ſtranger in the land, &amp; as a wayfaring man that turns aſide to tarry for a night. Why ſhouldſt thou be as a man aſtonied, as a mighty man that cannot ſave. Yet thou O Lord art in the middeſt of us, and we are called by thy name, leave us not.</hi> Doe not according to our ſinnes, but thy Name, thou art the hope of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and it hath been thine office, worke, to ſave <hi>Iſrael,</hi> why ſhouldſt thou be a ſtranger, as if thou hadſt nothing to doe, no right in us.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Gods judgements puzzle even Prophets, they ſee not into the equity and depths of them: Now that all were ſlaine in the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:117768:133"/> Temple, the Citie, and all in it ruining, the Prophet is aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and knows not what to make of it, that wrath ſhould be ſo fully powred upon <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> that God would leave himſelfe no people, no place to be worſhipped in, fruſtrate the hopes of his people touching the promiſed ſeede, and make void all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes thereabout, and give up the holy land to prophane uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed wretches, this puzzl'd him.</p>
                     <p>There is ſomething ever in Gods judgements which wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach, and then becauſe they proceede croſſe to our wills, expectations, deſires, wee are ready to think hardly of them, and boile in our ſpirits againſt heaven; but we muſt remember Gods wayes are not ours, he is ever righteous in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though we ſee not the reaſon thereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. <hi>Thy judgements are a great deepe.</hi> Some referre it to providence, thus, mens ſins are a deep ſea of wickedneſſe, yet Gods providence is a greater deepe, which orders them, ſinners, and all things.</p>
                     <p>Others take it literally; Gods judgements in puniſhing ſinnes is ſuch a depth that no humane underſtanding can ſound: Our Prophet could not doe it, neither the Apoſtles, and therefore cryes out, <hi>how unſearcheable are his judgements.</hi>

When the firſt Table is violated, the ſecond Table will not be preſerv'd. If men make not conſcience of ſins againſt God, they will not make conſcience of ſins againſt men. If there be Atheiſme in the Church, there will be Tyranny in the State: If Idolatry in the Sanctuary, there will be perverting of equity in the Citie.</p>

                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. To let us underſtand that the Lord is more ſolicitous about the welfare of the godly then the ruine of the wicked; he had a tender care of his mourners and mark'd ones, he was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to hear of their ſafety, and acceptance of his love, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt haſtens to make report of what was done; they are all ſeal'd, and ſo ſecur'd.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To revive the drooping ſpirit of <hi>Ezek.</hi> who was perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and greatly caſt down at the bloody ſlaughter of his people. He was yet in the Temple, and the report was made in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that ſo he hearing it was wel with all the godly mourning party, might be comforted. Had the other ſix come in and told how many thouſands they had ſlain, this would have added af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to him that was afflicted.</p>
                     <p>That Chriſt is a faithfull and forward executioner of Gods will: God bid him goe and ſeal thoſe mourned in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1.</note> and preſently he did it, comes and informes his father of it, <hi>I have done as thou haſt commanded me,</hi> both what was commanded, and as it was commanded, <hi>Iob.</hi> 14.31. <hi>As the Father gave me comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, even ſo I doe.</hi> He doth the will of his Father, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then he would have it done, hee minded what was to be done, and the manner of doing it. Here is a pretious pattern of obedience for us: Doth Chriſt doe the will of his father, not his own; and ſhall we doe our wills and not the Lords? Its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument then that we are neither of Chriſt, nor of God, but of our ſelves. Moſt men when God appoints, commands, they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neglect or doe it not ſpeedily, or not in that manner they ought to doe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thoſe that faithfully and conſcientiouſly execute the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion given them of God, may boldly give up their accompts to God. The man here cloathed with linnen had done his duty, executed his Commiſſion to the full, and he could with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:117768:140"/> and confidence come before the Lord, and ſay, I have done as thou haſt commanded me. When Chriſt was on earth, and had many commands from his Father, and great worke to doe, he did perform what was impos'd, and ſo exactly, that hee could at end of the day when his worke was done, with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence give up his accompt, give in his report, and ſay, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the worke thou gaveſt me to do, and now O father glorifie me with thy ſelf.</hi> He did not his own will, but his Fathers will, not his own works, but his Fathers works. If we doe the will and work of God, we ſhall be able to lift up our heads, and comfortably to make report of what we have done.</p>
                     <p>The unjuſt Steward when call'd to give accompt, could not doe it with comfort or confidence; thoſe abide in the doctrine &amp; work of Chriſt ſhall have confidence before Chriſt at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: You are in place look to your charge, can you ſay with him in the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.22. <hi>Lord it is done as thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Chriſt delights in doing good to, and ſecuring of thoſe his Father affects: Mourners here pleaſed God; he ſends Chriſt to ſeale them and comfort them, and quickly returns to ſatisfie the mind of his Father, and to ſhew what delightfull worke that is unto him. Chriſt was as carefull afterwards as now, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.39. <hi>This is the Fathers will which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me I ſhould looſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up againe at the laſt day.</hi>

                     <p>There is a difference between the words, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.22. where it's ſaid, <hi>the firmament upon the heads of the living creature:</hi> And the words here which are <hi>the firmament that was above the head of the Cherubims;</hi> there its <hi>living creature and heads,</hi> here its <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims and head,</hi> which may mind us of their oneneſſe and conſent in judgement and operations. If there be heads, its but as one living creature acts from thoſe heads; if there be Cherubims, they have all but as one head.</p>
                     <p>Why are they cal'd Cherubims here, and not living creatures as before?</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe the reaſon is this: The former viſion was at <hi>Chebar,</hi> in the open field by a rivers ſide, this was in the Temple where the Cherubims were, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.6, 7. and ſo that notion ſuited with them there.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In <hi>Babylon,</hi> a prophane land, the Prophet ſees living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he had a generall and confus'd apprehenſion of them; but when he is in the Temple, he hath a more cleare and diſtinct knowledge of them. Hence you have this note, The Lord did more clearely make known himſelfe and myſteries in the holy land then in other places, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.1. In <hi>Judah</hi> is God knowne more fully and familiarly then elſewhere: A viſion in <hi>Babylon</hi> is not ſo cleare as a viſion in <hi>Sion, Pſalm</hi> 29.9. <hi>In his Temple doth every one ſpeake of his glory.</hi>

Angels have great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the affairs of the world; there are ſcarce any naturall motions, but they have influence into them, winds, tempeſts, thunders, earth-quakes, plagues, famines: ſo for other wheels in
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:117768:145"/> Kingdomes and Churches, which have voluntary motions, as wars, tumults, diviſions, changes, &amp;c. theſe be not accidentall, caſuall, but have ſuperior agents.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Lord doth uſe the Miniſtery of Angels in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his judgements, eſpecially his fiery judgements: The fire was between the Cherubims, God had given them charge of the fire, and they were to kindle a fire in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> You heard in <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. of the 6. Angels that had their ſlaughter-weapons, and were ſent out of God to deſtroy utterly, man, woman, maid, and child, they are ready to execute his judgements, they are flames of fire, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.7. and its ſuitable to them to be employed in fiery judgements.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Lord Chriſt hath power over the Angels and all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour creatures, the Cherubims are over the wheels, and Chriſt is over them and the wheels too; he goes in between the wheels, and takes fire that is between the Cherubims. Let ſervices of what nature ſoever be in the hands of the creatures, men or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Chriſt can ſtep in and do what the Father hath appointed, over-rule the motions of the higheſt and loweſt wheels, of the nobleſt or meaneſt creatures.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Chriſt hath variety of diſpenſations, hee is a diſpenſer of judgment as well as mercy, he diſpenſeth the favours of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the wrath of the Father. In <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. he marks the mourners, and here he ſcatters coals of fire: He repreſents ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall perſons; ſometimes the ſame man hath ſate in <hi>Parliament,</hi> hath been a Warriour in the fields, a Father in the family, and acted anſwerably. A Steward provides for thoſe in the family, and puniſheth thoſe are Delinquents in it. So Chriſt is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon the Throne, doing acts of mercy, ſometimes acts of juſtice, and ſometimes he is off the Throne, &amp; acts as a ſervant.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. When the Lord is wrath with a people, and intends judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he turns thoſe creatures have been very comfortable and uſefull unto them, to a terrour unto them: Fire, what a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, what a refreſhing creature is it? and now fire muſt be taken to fire their City, to burn down all, that through the help of fire was built; they had abuſed fire to maintain their gluttony, for fulneſſe of bread was one of their ſins, they burnt Incenſe to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diot, and abuſed the Altar fire, which had been the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing to their ſoules; their ſacrifices were by fire, and were
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:117768:145"/> conſumed by fire, they had acceptance with God, attonement was made, and now even this fire kindled upon them.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Terrible judgements are in the hand of Chriſt, and come out from him: <hi>Fill thy hand with coales, and ſcatter them over the City.</hi> This is ſpoken <hi>humanitus,</hi> not that Chriſt tooke coals, but hee hath that is analogous unto coales, fiery vertue, creative power of any dreadfull judgements. When Chriſt ſaid to the man had not on the wedding garment, <hi>friend, how,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>take him, bind him hand and foote, caſt him into utter darkeneſſe,</hi> this was dreadfull. In <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.27. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.2. Chriſt appeared like a man of fire. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.14, 15. Chriſts eyes and feete were like unto fire; in the two firſt places hee was in a way of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the laſt, againſt the <hi>Churches,</hi> &amp; had fiery judgements in his hand. They are in his power to produce, to encreaſe, to order and moderate; he can make a judgement terrible and fiery, continue it as long as he pleaſes. He hath fire in his hand, and can ſcatter it when and where he pleaſes; hee ſcattered it upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> here, upon it afterward when <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> beſieged it; he ſcattered fire upon the <hi>Jewes,</hi> which conſumes and waſts them to this day; he ſcattered fire upon the 7. Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which diſſolv'd them: and hath he not ſcattered coales of contention and warre among us, which burn and conſume us daily, and threaten the foundations of Church and State? We may think its this man and that man that throws the coals, but its Chriſt doth it, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.49. <hi>I am come to ſend fire on the earth.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">That fire comes out from a bramble, <hi>Judg. 9.15.</hi> is not ſo much: but that fire ſhould come out from the vine, from Chriſt, this is ſtrange.</note> And <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.34. <hi>Thinke not that I am come to ſend piece on earth, I came not to ſend peace, but a ſword; for I am come to ſet a man at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance againſt his father, and the daughter againſt her mother, and the daughter in law againſt her mother in law, and a mans foes ſhall be they of his owne houſehold.</hi> The coales are ſcattered, the fire is kindled, and who can put it out; its Chriſt hath power over fire, you muſt ſue earneſtly to him to quench the violence of that fire burnes amongſt us.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. None can deſtroy or fire a City, unleſſe God give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and commiſſion for it; goe, take coales, and ſcatter them upon the City: The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> could never have burnt <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> if the Lord had not bid them. Hence ſaith the Prophet, <hi>evill came downe from the Lord unto the gate of Jeruſalem, Mich.</hi> 1.12.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:117768:146"/> It's an evill that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be burnt; but this evill was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd in heaven, a commiſſion for it came from thence, and it's the Lord ſends the fire to the gates thereof. Till God give out the word, it cannot be done, how ſinfull ſoever Cities be: <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was full of pride, gluttony, oppreſſion, blood, atheiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, idolatry, &amp;c. yet none could fire it, till God ſaid, <hi>ſcatter coales upon the Citie:</hi> and when he ſaith ſo, nothing can privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Citie from burning. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the Citie he had <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.27. There was the Temple, and all the chiefe worſhip, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. So famous was it for viſion, that it was cal'd <hi>the valley of viſion, Iſa.</hi> 22.1. <hi>The City of ſolempnities, Iſa.</hi> 33.20. <hi>The Citie of God, Pſalm</hi> 46.4. And the Inhabitants of this City were <hi>Abrahams ſeede, Mat.</hi> 3.9. Gods <hi>firſt-borne, Exod.</hi> 4.22. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 5. You have 8. priviledges of theirs ſet downe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; the <hi>adoption,</hi> the <hi>glory,</hi> the <hi>covenant,</hi> the <hi>law,</hi> the <hi>ſervice,</hi> the <hi>promiſes,</hi> the <hi>fathers,</hi> and <hi>diſcent of Chriſt</hi> were all <hi>theirs.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding the City was ſuch, and Inhabitants ſo privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, yet God would have <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> burnt, he deſtroyes the people, and their chiefe glory with them: Let no Cities ſtand upon their priviledges after <hi>Jeruſalem. Rome</hi> thinks ſhee hath much to glory in; but <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.8. <hi>Shee ſhall be utterly burnt with fire, and Kings who have ſerved her, ſhall ſee and bewail the ſmoake of her burning, v.</hi> 9.

                     <p n="10">10. Chriſt is obedient to the commands of his Father, even in execution of ſevere judgements. When the Lord bade him ſeale the mourners, he did it, and now he bade him take and ſcatter coales over the City, he went about it; he did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, delay, but immediately did what his Father commanded. This ſhould beget in us ſuch a tractableneſſe and conformity to Chriſt, that what-ever our heavenly Father counſels or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us, we ſhould preſently hearken thereunto, and yeeld o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. God makes known to his Prophets what he will doe; all was ſaid and done in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> preſence, he was privy to, and witneſſe of all. Its a great honour to be neare, to ſee and heare the tranſactions of God and Chriſt: Such honour had our

                     <p>This was Chriſt ſay Expoſitors, who was in his glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition, and now in the Temple, but going out of it. He had once before done thus, gone off from the Cherub to the threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old,

                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.3. but was return'd again, and here the ſecond time doth it, he was now in a judiciary way, and would leave the Temple, if they did not preſently prevent it by repentance.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt ſtanding thus upon the threſhold, and being upon termes of departure, behinde him was the cloud that fill'd the houſe, there was darkneſſe: but before the Lord Chriſt was light and brightneſſe, the Court which he ſtood looking into was full of brightneſſe of the Lords glory: The glory was now gone out of the Sanctuary into the Court.</p>
                     <p>Obſervations ſuitable to this verſe ſee upon <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.3. yet take here theſe following.</p>
                     <p>When God is about to viſit his Church with ſome ſharp judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he gives out ſome evident ſigns and tokens thereof.<note place="margin">

                     <p n="2">2.

Where Chriſt is, there is glory, and where his ordinances are, there is glory.</p>

                     <p>Angels watch, and take opportunites to ſerve Chriſt; he comes unto them to take fire, and preſently one of them takes the fire and puts it in his hand, being glad of ſuch an opportunity to doe him ſervice. Angels are vigilant creatures, and wait for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, and when they come they will not loſe them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20. <hi>They hearken to the voyce of his word,</hi> they neither ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nor ſleep, but hearken conſtantly what the Lord will ſay, what opportunity there will be for action: ſo in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.11. they are deſcribed with their wings ſtretched upward, manifeſting their watchfulneſſe and readineſſe for ſervice. When Chriſt was born, a multitude of them appeared and celebrated his nativity, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.13.

Let us learne of Angels, watch opportunities, and take them. There be nicks of time wherein to doe the works of Chriſt, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.1. <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe under the heaven.</hi> It's wiſdome to obſerve thoſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and times, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. <gap reason="foreign">

More cannot be required or expected by any ſuperior and divine power, more cannot be performed by any creature: They are Angelicall, who can reſign up all into the hand of Chriſt. Let us learn this duty: The Scribe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.19. ſaid well, <hi>Maſter I will follow thee whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou goeſt:</hi> I will trace thy ſteps, learn thy doctrine, doe thy will, be at thy diſpoſe: And <hi>Iſa.

If Angels did it, whoſe nature Chriſt tooke not, for whom he dyed not; how much more ſhould we doe it, whoſe nature he took, for whom he did and ſuffered all.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Things done ſeaſonably are acceptable to Chriſt, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel obſerv'd Chriſt comming for fire to demand their ſervice, and he takes fire and puts into Chriſts hand, and Chriſt tooke it; which notes his acceptance. He neither reprov'd nor reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Angel or his ſervice, but was well pleaſed, the putting fire into his hand was ſeaſonable, and ſo acceptable: There be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which if taken, ſweeten actions, and open the doore for their better entertainment, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.11. <hi>A word fitly ſpoken is like apples of gold in pictures of ſilver.</hi> The <hi>Heb.</hi> is, <hi>a word ſpoken upon its wheels.</hi> Fit times and ſeaſons are wheels to carry words with great advantage: and ſo for actions; when things are done in the due time, they are beautifull, acceptable; when God gives raine to a Land in ſeaſon, how acceptable is it; when a tree bears fruit in its ſeaſon, its gratefull: So when Angels or men do things ſeaſonably, its pleaſing to the Lord Chriſt: there <hi>be ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea tempora,</hi> which if we miſſe, actions are unlovely, and miſſe of their aimes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.6. <hi>For this ſhall every one that is godly, pray unto thee in a time when thou maiſt be found.</hi> There be times, if we have the wiſdome to diſcern them, when prayer will be ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, acceptable, effectuall.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The explication of the <hi>wheels,</hi> and that is in the 13. <hi>verſe:</hi> it was cryed <hi>O wheel!</hi> O world!</p>
                  <p>I have ſpoken largely of the wheeles in the firſt chapter, and therefore now ſhall ſay little of them; the moſt will be of thoſe particulars wherein there is difference from what is there ſet downe.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Chap. mention is made, 1. of the living creatures, and then of the wheels; Here the wheels are firſt ſet down, and after them the Cherubims or living creatures: Why there is a great inverſion and change made in the viſion, I finde no reaſon given, neither do I conceive any ſatisfactory reaſon can be given, but the will of the Lord, it pleaſed him to repreſent the viſion in that way to the Prophet, and that may ſuffice us. Yet if we may conjecture, the wheels are ſet firſt here, for that changes &amp; moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> cauſes in the world are more obvious unto our eyes, wee obſerve them firſt, and that vertue acts them is more out of ſight.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Chap. <hi>v.</hi> 15. there is one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures; here in the 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> are 4. wheels by the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims, and the aſſignment of one wheel to one Cherub, which makes this part of the viſion more diſtinct and cleare.</p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:117768:154"/>
                  <p>Wheels ſet out all the motions and changes of things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: and the 4. wheels, all that are in the 4. parts of the world, and a wheel is a fit inſtance to reſemble them by, as hath beene ſhewn; and what ever appears caſuall, accidentall, confus'd and contrary, comes under the notion of the wheel.</p>
                  <p>That all things in this world have dependencie upon higher cauſes; the wheels conſiſt not of themſelves,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1.</note> but are by the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims, they have reference unto, and dependance upon them. The creatures are ſervants, not Maſters or Lords: and how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver things ſeeme to be carried in the world confuſedly, without any reſpect to any ſuperiour cauſes, yet the wheels are regulated, they are by the Cherubims, they have influence into them, and order them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lord is methodicall in diſpoſing the things of the world, each one of the Angels hath his wheel; they were not all by one Angell, or all 4. promiſcuouſly by the 4. Cherubims, but the wheels were methodically diſpoſed of, to each Angell one, and ſo they acted methodic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lly, and looked to their wheels in their ſeverall quarters. God hath ſet a wheel by every one of us; ſomething hee hath committed to our care and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, let us look to our wheels.</p>
                  <p>The 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> you have in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.16. only a little alteration of the words. In the firſt place it's they four had one likeneſſe, and their appearance was as it were a wheel in a wheel; in this place its, As for their appearances, they four had one likeneſſe, as if a wheel had been in the midſt of a wheel.</p>
                  <p>They were like in figure, in colour, and equall in quantity, as if one had been made by another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But if the wheels prefigure the motions and changes of things in the world as is affirmed, are the motions and events of things alike every where in all quarters of the world?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We ſee that otherwiſe; there be warres in one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and peace in another; Riches in one City, and poverty in another; the Goſpel leaving one place, and going to another, yet are they alike in that they repreſent.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are changes every where, good and bad, one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration goes, another comes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are great difficulties, perplexities in all mundane
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:117768:155"/> affairs, not only in one place, but in all places.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In that they all worke, and further Gods great deſigns in the world, they goe on in one Kingdome as well as another.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In that they are all ordered to produce that great end, Gods glory, not any wheel but is productive of it.</p>
                  <p>As if a wheel had been in the middſt of a wheel; ſome thinke there were in every wheel four ſemi-circles, or halfe wheels, which appeared as a wheel in the midſt of a wheel, but we find no warrant for that; the Text ſpeaks of a wheel in a wheel, it may be tranſverſe, one croſſing and cutting another, it may be comprehenſive, as one Orb in another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1.</note>That the wheels in all places are alike, they are not the ſame, but they are alike. Such is mans nature, that it's not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with it's condition, but thinks that all things move better elſe-where then at home, and hereupon many have made tryall of forreign Nations, remote parts of the world, and found the wheels there like the wheels in their owne Countrey, full of changes and intricacies, ſo they were in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> dayes, ſo they will be in our dayes: ſo they were in <hi>Babylon,</hi> in <hi>Sion,</hi> ſo they are in <hi>England,</hi> and will be; we ſhould learn to make the beſt of our condition; if the wheels be alike in changes &amp; perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, then they are alike in furthering Gods deſigns, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Gods glory, and this they may doe as ſtrongly and ſpeedily at home as they doe abroad.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Man is not able to judge of Gods works and wayes in his adminiſtration of the world. They are ſo intricate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> knew not what to make of them, hee ſaw as it were a wheel in the midſt of a wheel, one wheel intangled in another. The acts of Providence at this day in Churches and States are ſo various and dubious, that created abilities cannot comprehend Gods intentions. It's ſaid, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.6. <hi>In that day the light ſhall neither be clear nor darke:</hi> Men ſhall be puzzled not knowing what to judge: this day is come upon us, can you tell what to judg of the wheels and their motions amongſt us, they are much intangled; we have croſſe motions from without, and from within; is there any great or publique buſineſſe in the Kingdome, but is perplexed, and the iſſue of it uncertain: Our Councels are intangled, our Military affairs at Sea and Land,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:117768:155"/> our City and domeſticks buſineſſes are not without wheels in them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a coherence of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> cauſes and motions which are from them, they are knit and linked together; our Prophet ſaw a <hi>wheel in the midſt of a wheel,</hi> one change follows upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and there is a concatenation of cauſes; and their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Cherubims were by the <hi>wheels,</hi> and <hi>wheels</hi> in the <hi>wheels, Sathan, Chaldeans, Sabeans,</hi> the winds and humours in <hi>Jobs</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy did all conſpire to humble and afflict him; after theſe, his 3. friends tread in the ſame path, and adde to his affliction, night and day, winter and ſummer have not a nearer coherence then the <hi>wheels:</hi> They ſo run among us, that we are neceſſitated to ſit in Counſell, and Counſels beget actions, actions make alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, alterations make ſtrange impreſſions in mens ſpirits. It's eaſie to ſee the puzling intricacies of the <hi>wheels,</hi> how croſly, perverſly things move every where; but the coherence and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious part of them is not ſo quickly diſcern'd, the lines in a globe, the roaps in a ſhip croſſe one another, which every eye ſeeth, but their harmony and uſe is not ſo diſcernable. The Bees when they ſwarm without, and work within, make a thouſand croſſe motions, and yet there is ſweet harmony in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
                  <p>The 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>verſe,</hi> which ſpeaks of their motion, agrees in part with the 17. of the firſt <hi>Chap.</hi> where it's ſaid, <hi>when they went, they went upon their four ſides,</hi> and ſo the words are here, <hi>and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned not when they went,</hi> here it is, <hi>they turned not as they went,</hi> and it's twice ſo; then here is an addition which is not there. But to the place, <hi>whither the head looked they followed it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The meaning of the words is, that they went to thoſe parts of the world which were upon their ſides, and their motions in thoſe wayes were like and uniform, none went backward when others went forward.</p>

The Peacocks train which is full of eyes, how beautifull and glorious is it, yet farre ſhort of the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:117768:157"/> beauty and glory is in Gods government of the world. When the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſaw ſo much wiſdome in a man, ſo much glory and beauty in the order of his houſe, ſhe admired, and had no ſpirit left in her, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.4, 5.

This alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath occaſioned diverſity of opinions among Interpreters. Some affirm, that anciently they pictured the Cherubims with the face of an Oxe, and that there is no difference between their faces; but we find no proof of this, and it is as eaſily denyed as affirmed. Others think the viſion was ſo, that the Prophet firſt ſaw an Oxes face, which he knowing, cals the face of a Cherub. <hi>Flavius Joſephus</hi> affirms the face of a Cherub to be the face of a
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:117768:160"/> Bird, whoſe likeneſſe God ſhewed to <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Mount-Horeb,</hi> but was never ſeen of of men.

Some make this face of a Cherub to be the face of a child,<note place="margin">Rabbi David pagn. in lexico. Solom:</note> and the common form of picturing Cherubims hath been like a young man or boy; therefore a <hi>Rabbi</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cherub eſſe puerum elegantem,</hi> and many are of that judgement. Even <hi>Lavater</hi> he makes the face of a Cherub to be the face <hi>putri alait.</hi> Cherub ſounds like <hi>Recheb,</hi> a Chariot, and the Cherubims are call'd ſo, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.18.

But I finde no warrant given us to tranſpoſe letters in the words of ſacred writ, and thereupon to make expoſitions. The Text ſaith, it was the face of a Cherub: and if the Spirit of God had meant the face of an Oxe, he could have as eaſily ſaid here <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The Scripture calls that ſometime the ſame, which is neare or like unto it, and tends to the ſame end, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4. <hi>The fathers did all eate the ſame ſpirituall meat, &amp; drinke the ſame ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all drinke.</hi> Mannah was their meat, and water out of the rock was their drink, theſe differ from the Bread and Wine in the Supper of the Lord; yet becauſe they tended to the ſame end, and had ſome likeneſſe, he calls them the ſame: So here, there was much likeneſſe, and they tended to the ſame end the former faces and living creatures did, and therefore he ſaith it was the living creature he ſaw before, and the faces the ſame; three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not at all from thoſe he ſaw before, only one, which made it not another creature, nor the faces other faces.</p>
                  <p>There be divers queſtions moveable about this face of a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rub, as why it's put off, and the face of the Oxe left out; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prophet had in this viſion only the appearance of the face of a Cherub, or of an Oxe alſo; why not ſome other face left out, rather then that of the Oxe, which are curious and needleſſe I ſhall paſſe themby, only one queſtion I ſhall anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Why are they called Cherubims rather then Men, Lyons, Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, ſeeing they had one face of a man, one of a lyon, and one of an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, as well as of a Cherub?</hi>

The ſpirit of life was in the <hi>wheels,</hi> and in the <hi>Cherubims.</hi> There is no publique or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate agent, rationall or irrationall creatures uſed in the motions of the world; but the ſpirit is in them all, the ſpirit was at the creation of all, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Job</hi> 26.13. and the ſpirit is in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11.

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:117768:162"/> operations they have, the ſpirit of life wrought them in them, and works by them. This may quiet our ſpirits, whatever is done in the world by the creatures; however the <hi>wheels</hi> move, they move not of themſelves, but the ſpirit is in them moves them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſtands and motions of <hi>Cherubims</hi> and <hi>wheeles</hi> are neither diſorderly, nor unſeaſonable; they ſtop, they ſtir at the dictates of the ſpirit of life which is in them, and that ſpirit is a ſpirit of wiſdome, appointing nothing to be done diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or unſeaſonably; When great ſtops are made on publique or more private buſineſſes, when they ſeem to us to goe backward, croſſe, to be untimely, it's the ſpirit of life that is in, and acteth by the ſecond cauſes, and who may with ſafety blame the ſpirit of God for ſtopping or turning the <hi>wheels,</hi> the times of the Spirit in all providentiall things are moſt ſeaſonable, and act moſt orderly.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p>The ground for their opinion is this; It's conceiv'd by ſome

                     <p n="1">1. In the viſion is ſet out to the Prophet the order of Gods departure from them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.4. the glory of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was there. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.5.

                     <p n="2">2. The concluſion of the viſion confutes that opinion; for <hi>verſ.</hi> 24, 25. it's ſaid that the viſion went up from him, that he was carried into <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and that he ſpake to the Captives what he had ſeen.

Thus did theſe Princes prophane that Propheſie, &amp; bred ſecurity in the hearts of the people, &amp; fed them with hopes of liberty and long life. Or thus you may take it, if this Citie be the cauldron, and we the fleſh, we will rather be boyled in it, then be deſtroyed by the ſword; we wil rather dye in the fire, be boyl'd to death, then fall into the hands of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; we will rather dye here, then yeeld our ſelves into their hands, be ſlain out of the City, or be carryed into <hi>Babylon,</hi> but we feare no ſuch thing: Thus theſe Princes eluded the Propheticall threats, hardned the people in their ill waye, and ripen'd them for deſtruction.</p>

God hath a ſpeciall eye to his own ſtatutes and judgements; when they are kept and performed, he proſpers, but when they are violated, he judgeth, he deſtroyes. Gods ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and judgements come from infinite wiſdome and holineſſe, they are good, equall, profitable: and for the ſonnes of men that depend upon God every moment for their lives and beings, to neglect the Lords ſtatutes, to tranſgreſſe them, and doe after their owne wills, humours, fancies, or others, this is unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wrong to God, and he hath, doth, and will viſit for ſuch wrongs: If men would not be broken with his judgements, let them not break his ſtatutes; if they would ſecure their lives, let them walk in his lawes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lords owne people are prone to take up the manners and cuſtomes of other Nations. <hi>Yee have done after the manner of the heathen:</hi> and not one heatheniſh nation only, but of all round about you; they obſerved their manners of life, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of worſhip, liked, fetched them in, and practiſed the ſame. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.9. <hi>They made them Prieſts after the manner of the nations of other lands.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.32. <hi>Wee will be as the heathen, as the families of the Countries.</hi> Such conformity had they with the heathen, that <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Seir</hi> could ſay, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25.8. <hi>Behold, the houſe of Judah is like to all the heathen.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. When Gods people take up the manners of heathens, and Nations hatefull to God, it provokes him greatly, and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the evill much.</p>
                  <p>In this caſe, 1. They reject Gods ſtatutes and wayes, they laid them by, and walked not in them; yet <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.8. <hi>No nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under heaven had ſtatutes and judgements ſo righteous as they.</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.15. <hi>They rejected his ſtatutes, &amp; his commandements, his

                  <p n="2">2. There was a prohibition, that they ſhould not doe after the wayes of the heathens. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.30. <hi>Take heed thou be not ſnared by following them, and that thou enquire not after their gods,</hi>

                  <p>Some doubts lye wrapt up in this verſe, and muſt be cleared: our Prophet was in body amongſt the Captives in <hi>Babylon;</hi> in ſpirit he was in the Temple at the Eaſt-gate of the Lords houſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. of this <hi>Chap.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Q.</hi> How <hi>Ezek.</hi> ſaith here, <hi>when I propheſied, Pelatiah dyed?</hi> when as he had yet propheſied nothing, he was now in a viſion, and <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25. after this he was return'd by the ſpirit into <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi>
                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:117768:180"/> and then hee ſpake all the things the Lord had ſhewed him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Some think that by prophecying here is not meant actuall prophecying, as if our Prophet did propheſie, and give out what the Lord ſaid; but the hearing of propheſie, and that place is brought to juſtifie it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Every woman that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or prophecyeth;</hi> that is ſay they which heareth propheſie, and ſo they will have our Prophet only to heare propheticall truths which the Lord gave out, and that <hi>Pelatiah</hi> ſhould dye; but this ſenſe of the words ſeems harſh, and the Text ſaith he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed, he did not heare propheſie, hear <hi>Pelatiah</hi> ſhould dye; why at the hearing of theſe things ſhould he fall down upon his face, and cry out as he did?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lord had great indignation againſt theſe men gave ill counſell, and bids <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>kiel</hi> propheſie, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. and doubles the command, <hi>propheſie, propheſie againſt them,</hi> and then the ſpirit fell upon him, <hi>v.</hi> 5. &amp; bade him ſpeak, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it might well be, that he propheſied (while he was in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) viſionally, and ſo had a viſionall ſight of <hi>Pelatiah's</hi> death: and then after when he came to them in the captivity, he ſpake to the captivity all the things that the Lord had ſhewed him, and there the reall death of <hi>Pelatiah</hi> was.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Prophet wrote this ſtory after hee had propheſied in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſo might inſert theſe words here being upon the ſtory of theſe 25. men; for it is uſual in Scripture to ſet that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which was done after.</p>
                  <p>Q. 2. <hi>But then a ſecond doubt ariſes; if Ezekiel were in Babylon, and propheſied there, how could this prophecie reach the men that were at Jeruſalem to them it belong'd, and the Prophets voyce could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to their eares?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Be it granted that the Prophet was at a diſtance from them at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet the vertue of the propheſie, though not the words, might, and did extend to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> When <hi>Ezekiel</hi> fell really to propheſie againſt theſe men, then <hi>Pelatiah</hi> dyed: When <hi>Iſaiah</hi> propheſied againſt <hi>Babylon, Moab, Damaſcus, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia,</hi> and <hi>Aegypt, Iſa.</hi> 13.15.17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Chapters,</hi> hee was at a great diſtance from them, yet the propheſies were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled upon them.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="357" facs="tcp:117768:180"/>2. There was intercourſe betweene thoſe at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and thoſe in <hi>Babylon, Jer.</hi> 29.1.3. <hi>Zedekiah ſent Elazah</hi> and <hi>Gema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah to Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſent letters to them, to acquaint them with his propheſie concerning them, and by thoſe men or others, might <hi>Ezekiels</hi> propheſie be made known to them at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. 3. <hi>How knew Ezekiel that Pelatiah dyed at that time when he propheſied?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This he might know by comparing the tidings of his death, by meſſengers brought unto him, and certifying the time, day, and hour thereof, comparing the ſame with the time of his prophecying; for <hi>Pelatiah</hi> being a Prince of the people, great notice would be taken of his death, and the houre of it flye abroad ſwiftly, and that to <hi>Babylon. Ezek.</hi> 33.21. When the City was beſieged, one got away, and brought tidings thereof to <hi>Ezek.</hi> much more eaſily might they doe it before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſpirit of propheſie might certifie our Prophet hereof, that when he did propheſie, <hi>Pelatiah</hi> ſhould dye at that time. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah</hi> could tell <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> that he ſhould never come off the bedde he lay ſick upon, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.4. And <hi>Abijah</hi> could tell <hi>Jeroboams</hi> wife that when her feet entred into the City, the child ſhould dye, 1 <hi>K.</hi> 14.12. and <hi>v.</hi> 17. when ſhe came to the threſhold of the door, the child dyed.</p>
                  <p>Qu. 4. <hi>How comes it to paſſe that theſe</hi> 25. <hi>men, not being of the number of mark'd ones, Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>eſcaped the ſword of the ſixe ſlaughter-men, when they ſlew all unmark'd ones in the Sanctuary, &amp; in the City?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They were viſionally ſlain, not really, till the ſiege and taking of Jeruſalem by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> when alſo the other 24 periſhed, being carryed thence to the borders of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And whereas ſome think <hi>Pelatiah</hi> here dyed only viſionally, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract much from the words of the Prophet, who ſaith he dyed; you know he prophecyed againſt them all, the 25. and they were all cut off afterward: and if <hi>Pelatiah's</hi> death were viſional, why ſaw he not viſionally the death of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, <hi>Pelatiah</hi> was made an example, to ſhew the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and efficacy of this propheſie; for when the Captives under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that the thing was ſo at Jeruſalem, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> prophecyed
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:117768:181"/> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> that <hi>Pelatiah</hi> a Prince was ſtrucken dead by the hand of the Lord, they began to change their thoughts of them at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that they had done wiſely to ſtay it out there, and that themſelves were improvident in comming into <hi>Babylon:</hi> but now they ſaw God was going on with his judgements againſt them, and that ſafety was on their own ſide.</p>
                  <p>Of falling upon the face, and crying out, <hi>ah Lord God,</hi> ſee <hi>Ch.</hi> 9.8. where thoſe expreſſions have been opened.</p>

                     <head>Wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Iſrael.</head>
                     <p>Q. 5. <hi>What mov'd the Prophet to uſe theſe words; here was only the death of one man, and that a wicked man; had he ſeen thouſands cut off, ſmitten dead by the hand of God, he might have feared all the remnant of Iſrael, he knew there were many mark'd ones, commiſſion given to ſpare them, &amp; therefore why doth he conceive the Lord would make a full end of the remnant of Iſrael?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Some think <hi>Pelatiah</hi> being the chief of the Princes, and bearing great ſway (for <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſtood in awe of them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38.5.) among the people, that our Prophet ſpeaks in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, rather then his owne, and thus it's carryed. <hi>Pelatiah</hi> hath been our Councellor, hath great intereſt in us, we confide more in him then others, and now thou haſt cut him off who was our ſupport: <hi>Ah Lord, wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Iſrael.</hi> That the Prophet ſhould ſpeak in their perſon, I ſee nothing to induce it, it's not like ſo wicked a people would make ſo gracious an uſe of this judgment, but rather incourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in <hi>Jaazaniah</hi> and the reſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I conceive the words referre only to the Prophet, who ſeeing this ſtroake of God upon <hi>Pelatiah,</hi> cryed out ſo,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From his love to that people in generall, they were <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> and love is full of fears.</p>

He remembred <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.5, 6. the commiſſion given to the ſlaughtering Angels to be without pitty, to ſlay old and young, maids, women, children: and now ſeeing the judgement begun upon <hi>Pelatiah,</hi> he knew not but that it might proceed to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all, and he therefore ſaith, <hi>ah Lord God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Hee had received in this viſion much matter for propheſie,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:117768:181"/> which was not yet given out, and hereupon ſeeing <hi>Pelatiah</hi> ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, he cryed out ſo.</p>
                     <p>Q. 6. <hi>ſhould not Ezek. have rejoyced in the death of Pelatiah? Pſ.</hi> 58.10. The righteous ſhall rejoyce when he ſeeth the vengeance: <hi>Did not he neglect a duty, and ſo offend, ſeeing he wept and mourned?</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. They had a ſlippery unfaithfull heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.8. Their ſpirit was not ſtedfaſt with God, they were off, and on, no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in them, but full of changes.

                     <p n="3">3. They had a deceitfull, hypocriticall heart. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.20. <hi>A deceived heart hath turned him aſide;</hi> and <hi>Chapter,</hi> 10.6.

We muſt look out ſome other meaning of theſe words. When it pleaſed the Lord to bring his people out of Aegypt, he commanded them to be numbred, <hi>Numb.</hi> 1.2, 3. The names and number of all from twenty yeares old and upwards were to be taken, and when they were numbred they were to give every man a ranſome for his ſoule unto the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.12. In like manner, when they came out of Babylon they were numbred, as appeares, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. and 8. <hi>Chap. Nehem.</hi> 7. Where you have the number ſet downe, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 66.67. the whole Congregation together was forty two thouſand three hundred and threeſcore, beſides men and Maid ſervants ſeven thouſand three hundred thirty ſeven, and two hundred forty five Singing Men and Women.

Theſe ſought their Regiſter among thoſe that were reckoned by Genealogy, but it was not found therefore were they as polluted, put from the Prieſthood <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Every one that is written among the living in Jeruſalem, ſhall be called holy:</hi> He ſpeakes of great calamity, a deſtruction which ſhould be upon the Jewes, and few ſhould eſcape, but he that was left, and written among the living, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All thoſe who came to Jeruſalem from the Captivity, and were Citizens thereof, were written in ſome Book, Catalogue, or Regiſter,
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:117768:269"/> which was the writing of the houſe of Iſrael, and was called alſo the Booke of life, or of the living: For upon the death of a man, his name was razed out of this Booke, or if he did any thing unworthy the name and right of a Citizen; and then he was counted as a dead man.
